## User manual
The calculator is initiated in the Main.java class. The user will enter the first binary value, using the one and zero buttons. Next, the user will hit the operator button of the operation desired. Then, the user will enter the second binary value and hit the "=" button. The calculator will display the operation result as a binary value. The user can hit the "Bin/Dec" button to switch between displaying the result as a binary value, and as a decimal value. The user can do another calculation by hitting the "Clear" button.
